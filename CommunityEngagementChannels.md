# FAIR4RS Community Engagement Channels

## Introduction

The  FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) working group was jointly convened as an RDA WG, FORCE11 WG, and ReSA Taskforce in 2020. The FAIR4RS WG works in recognition of the role that software plays for the advancement of the research sector. https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-research-software-fair4rs-wg
The following communications and engamente channels span various platforms in order to reach our wide online community. Most of these are visible to the public, creating an account on such platforms will enable members to provide feedback/comments/editing rights to interact with this Working Group.

To encourage you to learn more about our working group these two short overviews will give you a glance of the work done so far.

## Get involved!

## 1. FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) WG
To be a member of the FAIR4RS community people only need to declare their interest by joining the group. First, join RDA for free https://www.rd-alliance.org/user/register, then join the group https://www.rd-alliance.org/node/69317 to receive updates (click “Join Group” once logged in).

Group updates are sent via the WG posts https://www.rd-alliance.org/node/69317/posts 
These posts are public, which means anyone can view them, but only members of RDA can create new posts and comment on posts. The purpose of this public board is to keep the community updated. The FAIR4RS Working group (WG) Steering Committee (SC) sends regular updates. Other RDA WG and Interest Groups (IG) members can also cross-post updates and notifications to the community. Initially, this is a tool for conveying information for members to consume. Nonetheless, we encourage the WG members to feel empowered to contribute to new posts or comment on existing posts about their activities relevant to FAIR4RS and inform the public, ask questions and share resources. 

## 2. Public list of engagement activities
https://github.com/force11/FAIR4RS/blob/master/CommunityEngagement.md
This table is public, which means anyone can view it, but only collaborators can edit it*. Here we display relevant events/activities where to present the work of the FAIR4RS working group (WG) to the general community, including links to the presentations (slides, videos, abstracts) when possible. We also look forward to co-organising events with our community members and other groups/organisations. All the members in our community are encouraged to update this list by getting in touch with the Steering committee to add events or activities**.

*Current collaborators are Paula, Dan and Fotis from the Steering Committee. Members can also submit a request to the Steering Committee for permissions to become a collaborator on this repository.
**Members are encouraged to send update requests with a Pull Request (PR) or a new issue via GitHub, or contacting the Steering Committee directly. 

In addition, the Events tab of the RDA WG https://www.rd-alliance.org/node/69317/events
display those WG events organised by the WG to keep the community updated. Usually these events are visible to the members of the working group (the options are: public, visible to only members of the group and visible to selected RDA groups).

## 3. Minutes of the Steering Committee meetings
https://github.com/force11/FAIR4RS/tree/master/meetings
These documents are public, which means anyone can view them, but only collaborators can edit (currently Paula, Dan, Fotis). Here we display general updates relevant to the work of the FAIR4RS WG led by the Steering committee and the community, these meetings are mostly administrative and for strategic planning of future activities. 

## 4. Subgroups work
We use subgroups to do focused work, where members of our community can join to collaborate and co-create with the support of a subgroup leader. Subgroup products can include documents that are co-authored by all or some of the subgroup members. Examples are whitepapers, surveys and blog posts. The initial subgroup work has mostly concluded, and descriptions of the subgroups are on our main page https://www.rd-alliance.org/node/69317
Future subgroups might be convened for future focused work activities.

## 5. Community Chat
